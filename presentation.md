Imagine. You're in New York City. It's late Friday afternoon and, as usual, you're on the command line. Suddenly, you remeber that you forgot to plan the big pub crawl! But, it starts any minute -- you don't even have time to open a web browser! Luckily, the creators of `pubcrawler` foresaw this exact scenario.

Experience Report: Overall great experience with dpm.

Challenges:

 It would have been preferable to perform more of the search algorithm in the database, but this was not possible, due to dpm's lack of support for arbitrary sql expressions. Instead, we got creative and cut some corners with our algorithm.
